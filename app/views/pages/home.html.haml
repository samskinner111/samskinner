    %h1 A brief overview
    %p Hi, my name is Sam Skinner and I seem to have a 16-year attention span. After a career of that length in academia, I had an equally long stint as a business owner.  By mid-2014, I was eager for a change and dove head-long into programming. I have been a Ruby on Rails developer since then and look forward to working for another decade at least.  I love learning; I also love working hard.  With two daughters grown and off to college, I can <strong>devote full-time</strong> to my new career.
    
  .talk-me
    %h3 A little about me.
    %p
      %span.wd-1
        I am a web developer.
      I love making web apps that are useful, beautiful, and intuitive. I get excited about not only using the best tools for the job, but finding better ones. I believe good design runs through the entire app, that clear, descriptive variable names are just as important as choosing the right font.

        I love Ruby, but...!
      I first learned to code in Fortran (way back when) and later worked a little with C.  I love the flexibility of Ruby.  Matz definitely hit his mark: "...to enjoy programming, and to be happy. That is the primary purpose of Ruby ...".  Ironically though, gaining a good feel for Ruby has  made me also appreciate the unique strengths of other languages, especially Javascript and R.

        I have high standards.
      I aspire to be a Senior Developer which to me means gaining a breadth of experience with multiple languages as well as keeping current with new methods and technologies.  It also means finding the most elegant solutions to problems â€”solutions that are robust but flexible to change as needs and technologies change.  

  .talk-you
    %h3 A little about you.

        You are a company that is team-oriented.
      You work collaboratively in many phases of development from planning stages through to production. You mostly work on-site and engage in regular stand-ups so the sharing of information and knowledge is easy. 
    %p
      %span.wd-2
        You take the time to mentor.
      Whether it is through pair-programming or other means of sharing knowledge and skills, you take the time to develop your developers.  You provide routine constructive feedback so they can grow and mature their skills.
    %p
      %span.wd-2
        You allow your developers to wear multiple hats.
      To be a well-rounded, full-stack, developer means working on front-end projects, back-end projects and issues of deploying to production.  Someday I may specialize somewhat but at present there is still so much that is new and interesting.  I am eager to learn all I can!
    %p
      %span.wd-1
        Of course, I ask for a fair wage, but
      I am more interested in what I can learn than what money I can earn.
