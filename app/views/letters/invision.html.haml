    %h1 Hi, InVision
    %h2 I'm Joe, and I like to build things. I think we should work together.

        I am a web developer.
      I make web apps that are useful, beautiful, and intuitive. I get excited about not only using the best tools for the job, but finding better ones. I believe good design runs through the whole product, from development to the customer's experience & satisfaction.

        I am not just a web developer.
      I thrive for adventure. Be it kayaking, hiking, and just about anything outdoors. In fact, the next thrill I seek is hang gliding. I am thrilled of the idea of working with people across the country because we moved into a RV and plan on spending the next year or so travelling. Meeting people in person would be uniquely awesome. I spent the past five years in the military and I really appreciate hard work. While I was in the military I set up multiple educational courses that are still ran today. During my combat deployment I held weekly classes teaching both American and Afghan soldiers the importance of concise communication for airspace, I would consider communication one of my strong points.

        I just graduated from Dev Bootcamp.
      I started programming before Dev Bootcamp, but I learned more in the past nine weeks than I've ever learned in any other nine week chunk of my life. At Dev Bootcamp, I learned how to learn new things, really quickly. I learned the appreciation of solving complex problems.

        I learned to love teamwork!
      But more importantly, Dev Bootcamp taught me to love learning. The dedication that it took was greatly outweighed by the personal growth and development. It showed me that no matter at what stage in life, there are always ways towards a more wholesome lifestyle.

        You are a company that understands the needs of the customer.
      You put the effort in to really solving problems and to create an efficient and enjoyable workplace. You have a team that understands the importance of the work environment for the employees that work there.

        You understand the modern workforce.
      From everything I have been able to read about InVision, what has impressed me the most is the work environment that is discussed throughout the site. Very few companies understand that the traditional work environment isn't necessarily the best for its employees. You have a culture of learning from the people who work at InVision. That's important to me, and I want to be a part of that.

        You have high standards.
      You have an experienced team that has worked to help people. The experience and knowledge the InVision team possesses is very inspiring. Just by looking at your team members, the care and effort put into their work really shows. InVision is more than just a customer service job to me, its a chance to be a part of a growing company and make an impact. I learn really quickly. I don't need to have my hand held along the way. A little support from you guys and I'll get up to speed faster than you expect. I know this because..

        I have high standards.
      Before Dev Bootcamp, I strived to work harder than anyone else in my cohort. I was working a full-time job in the military while remotely working on phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. I was never late to a pair programming session and was constantly asked if I had programming experience prior. Once Dev Bootcamp started, I was the first one in most mornings and last one out if I wasn't sleeping there. I became someone that people came to for help and worked on several of my side projects. I insisted on testing when others on my team wanted to skip it. I want to aid people at obtaining a happier life. I'll put in the extra work.
