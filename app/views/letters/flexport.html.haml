    %h1 Hi, Flexport

        I am a web developer.
      I make web apps that are useful, beautiful, and intuitive. I get excited about not only using the best tools for the job, but finding better ones. I believe good design runs through the whole product, from development to the customer's experience & satisfaction.

        I am not just a web developer.
      I thrive for adventure. Be it kayaking, hiking, and just about anything outdoors. In fact, the next thrill I seek is hang gliding. I am thrilled of the idea of meeting more outgoing people. I spent the past five years in the military and I really appreciate hard work. While I was in the military I set up multiple educational courses that are still ran today. During my combat deployment, I held weekly classes teaching both American and Afghan soldiers the importance of concise communication for airspace. I would consider communication one of my strong points.

        I graduated from Dev Bootcamp.
      I started programming before Dev Bootcamp, but I learned more in those nineteen weeks than I've ever learned in any other nineteen week chunk of my life. At Dev Bootcamp, I learned how to learn new things, really quickly. I learned the appreciation of solving complex problems.

        I learned to love teamwork!
      But more importantly, Dev Bootcamp taught me to love learning. The dedication that it took was greatly outweighed by the personal growth and development. It showed me that no matter at what stage in life, there are always ways towards a more wholesome lifestyle.

        You understand the modern world.
      I have been following Flexport for a while. Before I went to Dev Bootcamp I saw the intership and I wanted to apply. The importance of uniting the world with international trade is a major step forward for commerce. On top of the you have a culture of learning from the people who work at Flexport and from your customers. That's important to me, and I want to be a part of that.

        You have high standards.
      You have an experienced team that has worked to help people. The experience and knowledge that the Flexport team possesses is very inspiring. The care and effort put into their works really shows. Flexport is more than a customer or tech job to me, it's a chance to be a part of something I believe in that helps improve the world. I learn really quickly. I don't need to have my hand held along the way. A little support from you guys and I'll get up to speed faster than you expect. I know this because..

        I have high standards.
      Before Dev Bootcamp, I strived to work harder than anyone else in my cohort. I was working a full-time job in the military while remotely working on phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. I was never late to a pair programming session and was constantly asked if I had prior programming experience. Once Dev Bootcamp started, I was the first one in most mornings and last one out if I wasn't sleeping there. I became someone that people came to for help and worked on several of my side projects. I insisted on testing when others on my team wanted to skip it. I want to help people. I will put in the extra work.
